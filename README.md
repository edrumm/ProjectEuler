# ProjectEuler

My attempt at ProjectEuler challenges in Java

## Description

> "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require
more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant
and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind
to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."
